            IT Experiences:
            <br>
            I have done a few projects on my own, one of my most ambitious ones would be this website as I really wanted to show people
            what I could do and prove to myself that I had the skills that I have always wanted to have. In this website I show my skills
            of what I can do and also explain who I am as a person and my life experiences through schooling / workplace experiences and even 
            personal experiences in what I have done and what the field of IT is to me. 
            <br>
            The cards below show off my projects with a mini disciption, each of these projects can also be found on my GitHub page for
            if you would like to go check out any of them!
